# ``GivenWithLove``

The app displays a list of available gifts. Select a gift, then enter shipping information. Finally, write a gift message along with the recipient’s email addresses.

## Overview

Through this app, you’ll learn all about focus management in SwiftUI by using modifiers and wrappers like **FocusState** to help users navigate forms more effectively.

You'll learn how to:
- Use the **FocusState** property wrapper with both the **focused(_:)** and **focused(_:equals:)** modifiers.
- Manage focus in lists and with the MVVM design pattern.
- Use the **FocusedValue** and **FocusedBinding** property wrappers to track and change the wrapped values of focused views from other scenes.
